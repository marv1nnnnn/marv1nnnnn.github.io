# Engineering Meets Art: My Design Philosophy

As an engineer with a passion for digital art, I believe there's something beautiful about controlled complexity. This site represents my approach to merging technical precision with creative expression.

## My Design Principles

1. **Technical Artistry**: Code can be both functional and beautiful
2. **Immersive Experience**: 3D environments that engage multiple senses
3. **Personal Expression**: Technology should reflect the creator's personality
4. **Interactive Storytelling**: Every interaction should reveal something new

## Creative Influences

- **Suda51's Game Design**: Experimental narratives and visual boldness
- **Digital Ocean Simulations**: The beauty of mathematical visualization  
- **Shader Programming**: Where math becomes art
- **React Three Fiber**: Declarative 3D as creative medium

## Engineering Challenges

Building this experience required balancing:
- Visual complexity vs. performance optimization
- Creative expression vs. accessibility
- Technical innovation vs. browser compatibility
- Artistic vision vs. user experience

The result is a showcase of what's possible when engineering meets art.
