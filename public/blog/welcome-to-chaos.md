# Welcome to the Chaotic Early-Web OS

Welcome to my digital realm of beautiful chaos! This is what the web used to be like - personal, expressive, and wonderfully unhinged.

## What You'll Find Here

- **AI Personalities**: Chat with different AI entities, each with their own personality
- **Retro Programs**: Nostalgic recreations of classic desktop applications  
- **Visual Chaos**: Rainbow gradients, cursor trails, and maximum early-web energy
- **Interactive Experiments**: Mini-games, utilities, and digital art

## The Philosophy

This site celebrates the raw creativity of the early web era when:
- GeoCities ruled the internet
- Everyone had a personal homepage
- More was definitely more
- Animated GIFs were considered high art

## Technical Details

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and pure early-web aesthetic energy. Every element is designed to evoke that nostalgic feeling of browsing the web in 1999.

**Pro Tip**: Try opening multiple AI terminals and let them chat with each other!
