# 🚀 rooroo (如如): Minimalist AI Orchestration with Swiss Army Knife Agents 🚀

**Version: v0.0.7** [Changelog](changelog.md)

Welcome to `rooroo`, an AI-powered system designed to achieve **minimalist AI orchestration** for software development using a focused crew of **'Swiss Army Knife' agents** right within your VS Code environment via the [Roo Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code). Think of it as having a lean, expert virtual team, precisely coordinated.

## 🤔 What's in a Name? The Meaning of "rooroo (如如)"

The name "rooroo" comes from the term **"如如" (rú rú)** found in Buddhist philosophy. It relates to the concept of **Tathātā**, often translated as "Thusness" or "Suchness."

*   **Thusness/Suchness (真如):** Refers to the fundamental, unchanging, true nature of all phenomena – reality as it is.
*   **Equality & Non-Duality (不二平等):** Implies that, at the ultimate level, all things share this same essential nature.
*   **Emphasis:** The repetition "如如" emphasizes that this inherent "thusness" is pervasive across *all* things.

In the context of this project, the name evokes the idea of an underlying, consistent nature guiding the orchestration. This philosophy informs the **minimalist approach**, focusing on the essential 'thusness' of each agent's specialized role.

## 🎯 Key Problems Addressed

`rooroo` is designed to tackle common challenges in leveraging AI for software development:

1.  **Over-Complexity & Lack of Focus:** Many AI systems try to be everything, leading to complex, inefficient workflows. `rooroo` addresses this with a **minimalist crew of highly specialized agents**. Each agent acts like a focused **"Swiss Army Knife" component**, excelling in its specific domain (design, coding, validation, documentation), ensuring depth of expertise without unnecessary bloat.
2.  **Interaction Overhead & Delegation Bottlenecks:** Managing multiple AI interactions can be cumbersome. `rooroo` solves this by having a **single point of contact: the Master Orchestrator**. This central coordinator handles task delegation (potentially concurrently) and workflow management via a **split state management strategy** using `project_overview.json` and individual task files. Crucially, it can also resolve simple issues directly, reducing the overhead of delegating every minor task and preventing bottlenecks in the **minimalist orchestration**.
3.  **Inconsistent Development Practices:** AI-driven development can sometimes lack structure. `rooroo` promotes **Document-Driven Development (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. It enforces a structured workflow using specifications (`.specs/`, `.design/`) and validation (with reports in `.reports/`), and includes a dedicated **DocuCrafter** agent (another 'Swiss Army Knife') to manage project documentation (`.docs/`), ensuring clarity and reliability.

## 🤔 Initial Design Philosophy

The `rooroo` project was conceived with several core principles in mind, directly addressing the problems above:

*   **Simplicity & Minimalism:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. The agent team is kept to a focused minimum, with clear, distinct roles (Addresses Problem 1).
*   **Specialized Components (Swiss Army Knives):** Each agent is designed like a "Swiss Army Knife" component, highly capable within its specific domain (Addresses Problem 1).
*   **Centralized Orchestration & Split State:** A single Master Orchestrator manages the workflow and communication using a **split state management strategy** (`project_overview.json` for overview, `.state/tasks/{taskId}.json` for details), capable of handling simple tasks directly (Addresses Problem 2).
*   **Document & Test-Based Approach:** Emphasize clarity and reliability through a workflow encouraging DDD/TDD, supported by dedicated agents and structured artifacts (Addresses Problem 3).

## ✨ Why Use rooroo? ✨

`rooroo` offers a structured and efficient approach to AI-assisted development:

*   **🎯 Focused Expertise (Swiss Army Knife Agents):** Delegate tasks to the right AI expert. Instead of one generalist AI, `rooroo` uses highly specialized agents, leading to potentially higher quality results in each domain. (Solves Problem 1)
*   **⚙️ Simplified Orchestration with Split State:** You interact primarily with the **🧠 Master Orchestrator**. It handles the complexity of breaking down goals, delegating tasks (potentially concurrently), managing the workflow via a **split state management strategy** (`project_overview.json` and `.state/tasks/{taskId}.json`), and resolving minor issues, keeping your interaction focused and reducing overhead. (Solves Problem 2)
*   **🏗️ Structured Workflow:** `rooroo` follows a defined process (Design, Implement, Validate), bringing clarity and predictability, encouraging DDD/TDD practices. (Solves Problem 3)
*   **💾 Clear Artifacts:** Key outputs are organized (`.specs/`, `.design/`, `.docs/`, `.reports/`), creating a traceable project history and supporting the DDD/TDD approach. (Supports Problem 3)
*   **🎯 Focused Execution:** Each 'Swiss Army Knife' agent works on specific, delegated tasks based on clear inputs, reducing ambiguity and improving reliability. (Supports Problem 1 & 3)

## 🔑 Core Concepts

Understanding these ideas is key to leveraging `rooroo`:

1.  **Minimalist Agent Crew:** `rooroo` operates with a lean team of distinct AI agents (modes). Each agent is a focused 'Swiss Army Knife', optimized for a specific role.
2.  **Orchestration & Split State Management:** The **🧠 Master Orchestrator** mode is central. It interprets goals, plans strategy, delegates tasks to the 'Swiss Army Knife' agents (potentially concurrently), monitors progress via a **split state management strategy** (`project_overview.json` for overview, `.state/tasks/{taskId}.json` for details), handles simple issues, communicates with you, **prompts you for decisions after implementation**, and delegates test execution based on your input. (Key to solving Problem 2)
3.  **Swiss Army Knife Roles:** Each agent (Architect, UX Specialist, Implementer, Validator, DocuCrafter) has a clearly defined, specialized responsibility and operates precisely within that scope.
4.  **Structured Artifacts:** The system relies on artifacts (`.specs/`, `.design/`, `.docs/`, `.reports/`) to maintain context and provide clear inputs/outputs between agents, facilitating DDD.
5.  **Split State Management:** The workflow state is managed across two types of files: `project_overview.json` for high-level planning and task summaries, and individual `.state/tasks/{taskId}.json` files for detailed task information. This enables robust coordination while keeping individual task details focused.

## 🔄 The Core Development Workflow

`rooroo` guides feature development through a structured, **minimalist** lifecycle managed by the Orchestrator:

1.  **🎯 Goal Setting:** You provide your high-level goal to the **🧠 Master Orchestrator**.
2.  **✍️ Planning & Design:** The Orchestrator plans phases and delegates detailed design tasks to the relevant 'Swiss Army Knife' agents:
    *   **📐 Solution Architect:** Creates technical specifications (`.specs/`).
    *   **🎨 UX Specialist:** Defines user experience and UI design (`.design/`).
3.  **💻 Implementation:** Once designs are ready, the Orchestrator assigns precise coding tasks (potentially concurrently) to the **⚡ Apex Implementer**, referencing the specs. The Implementer writes unit tests but **stops before executing them**, updating the task status to `'Implemented'` in its individual task file and the overview.
4.  **❓ User Decision Point:** The Orchestrator detects the `'Implemented'` status in the overview and **prompts you** to decide the next step: run tests, skip to validation, or defer.
5.  **✅ Validation / Test Execution:** Based on your input, the Orchestrator delegates the next step:
    *   If you choose to run tests, a specific test execution task is delegated (often to the **🛡️ Guardian Validator**), referencing the original task's detail file.
    *   If you choose to skip to validation, the **🛡️ Guardian Validator** independently verifies the implemented features against the specifications (TDD aspect), generating reports in `.reports/`. The Validator updates its own task file and the overview status.
6.  **🔄 Iteration:** Based on validation or test results, the Orchestrator manages feedback loops, assigning refinements or fixes back to the appropriate agents by creating new tasks (both overview summary and detail file).

*(Note: Documentation tasks are handled separately by the DocuCrafter, see below).*
