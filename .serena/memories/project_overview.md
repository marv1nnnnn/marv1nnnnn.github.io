# Project Overview

## Project Purpose
The **Transmitter-Receiver OS** is a Suda51-inspired personal website that functions as a surreal, interactive desktop operating system. It recreates the aesthetic and narrative themes of the "Kill the Past" universe through a fragmented, unreliable interface that simulates a digital consciousness.

## Core Concept
- **Digital consciousness interface** with intentional glitches, unreliable data, and cryptic system messages
- **Conspiracy and fractured identity themes** with unstable information transmission
- **Interactive desktop OS simulation** that serves as a personal portfolio/website

## Key Features
- Cryptic boot sequence with procedural errors
- Draggable window system with applications
- 3D portfolio gallery with targeting mechanics  
- AI chat interface using xAI Grok API
- Procedural audio system (Web Audio API)
- Mini-games with "Soul Shells" currency
- Blog system with "Film Window" interface
- 3D music player with PS2-era aesthetic
