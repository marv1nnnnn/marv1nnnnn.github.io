## Task Elaboration (Optional Markdown Body)

Further details, context, or notes can go here if the YAML `Description` is insufficient.
The Agent should primarily rely on the structured YAML frontmatter but can reference this section if directed
or if frontmatter is clearly incomplete for a complex task.
