### **Project: Digital Void - Technical Design Document**

**Author:** AI Assistant
**Date:** October 27, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

### 1. Overview & Project Goals

This document outlines the technical approach for **"Project: Digital Void,"** a web-based interactive experience. The goal is to translate the first-person poetic narrative of a near-death psychedelic experience into a compelling visual and auditory journey for the user.

The experience will guide the user through a sequence of states:
1.  **The Unplugging:** A sudden transition from a "normal" state to nothingness.
2.  **The Void:** An empty, silent, dark space.
3.  **The Boot-up:** The birth of the digital ocean on the horizon.
4.  **The Ocean:** An immersive, full-screen view of a flowing, purple ocean of data.
5.  **The Dissolution:** The user's perspective dissolves into the ocean, accompanied by glitch effects, culminating in a serene, ambient state.

### 2. Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** **React 18+** (with Hooks)
*   **Build Tool:** **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds.
*   **3D Graphics:** **Three.js** as the core WebGL library.
*   **React-Renderer for Three.js:** **React Three Fiber (R3F)** to write the 3D scene declaratively within React components.
*   **R3F Helpers:** **Drei** for pre-built cameras, controls, and helpers.
*   **Post-Processing:** **React Postprocessing** for bloom, glitch, and other shader effects.
*   **Audio:** **Web Audio API** (or a lightweight library like `howler.js`) for the ambient hum and sound effects.
*   **Styling:** **CSS Modules** for scoped styling of the main container and UI overlays.

### 3. Component Architecture

The application will be structured with a clear separation of concerns, primarily separating the 3D scene from the application logic.

```
/src
|-- /components
|   |-- /scene
|   |   |-- DigitalOcean.jsx   // The main ocean mesh and material
|   |   |-- OceanShader.js     // GLSL code for the ocean shader
|   |   |-- PostFx.jsx         // Post-processing effects component
|   |   `-- SceneController.jsx // Manages camera, lighting, and state transitions
|   |-- AudioPlayer.jsx        // Manages all audio cues
|   `-- Experience.jsx         // Main component housing the R3F Canvas
|-- /hooks
|   `-- useExperienceState.js // Custom hook to manage the journey's state
|-- /assets
|   |-- /audio
|   |   |-- hum.mp3
|   |   `-- glitch.mp3
|   `-- /textures
|       `-- code_texture.png   // A texture of scrolling code/glyphs
`-- App.jsx                    // Top-level component, manages overall layout and state
```

**Component Breakdown:**

*   **`App.jsx`**: The root component. It will use the `useExperienceState` hook to manage the overall flow and render the `Experience` component.
*   **`Experience.jsx`**: This component will contain the R3F `<Canvas>`. It will be responsible for setting up the basic 3D environment.
*   **`SceneController.jsx`**: A critical "logic" component inside the canvas. It will subscribe to the global state and orchestrate the animations:
    *   Triggers the "boot-up line" animation.
    *   Controls camera movement (e.g., pan down to the ocean, move forward to dissolve).
    *   Fades the ocean in/out.
    *   Activates the glitch effects in `PostFx` during the "dissolution" phase.
*   **`DigitalOcean.jsx`**: This is the visual centerpiece.
    *   It will render a `<mesh>` with a `<planeGeometry>` (highly subdivided for smooth waves).
    *   The material will be a `<shaderMaterial>` that uses our custom `OceanShader.js`.
*   **`OceanShader.js`**: Contains the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) code.
    *   **Vertex Shader**: Will use Perlin/Simplex noise and a `time` uniform to displace vertices on the Y-axis, creating the wave motion.
    *   **Fragment Shader**: Will calculate the color based on vertex height and noise patterns to create the purple/amethyst aesthetic. It will also sample the `code_texture.png`, scrolling its UVs over time to create the illusion of flowing data within the waves.
*   **`PostFx.jsx`**: Manages all post-processing effects using `<EffectComposer>`.
    *   **`<Bloom>`**: Will be used throughout to give the purple ocean its signature glow. The intensity can be animated.
    *   **`<Glitch>`**: Will be disabled initially and activated during the "dissolution" phase to create the "fractured data packets" effect.
*   **`AudioPlayer.jsx`**: A non-rendering component that handles audio playback based on the application state. It will fade in the hum, play a boot-up sound, and trigger glitch sounds.

### 4. State Management

A simple state machine will control the user's journey. This can be managed with `useState` and `useContext` or a more dedicated custom hook (`useExperienceState`).

**States:**
1.  `INITIALIZING`: The very start. Fades to black.
2.  `IN_VOID`: Black screen, low hum starts. A timer is set for the next state.
3.  `BOOTING`: The "line of light" appears and expands.
4.  `OCEAN_REVEAL`: The ocean fades into view. Camera is positioned at a distance.
5.  `IMMERSIVE_OCEAN`: The user is "floating" above the ocean. Camera might have a slight, gentle bobbing motion.
6.  `DISSOLVING`: The camera moves forward into the ocean, glitch effects intensify.
7.  `ABSORBED`: The final state. Glitch effects cease, leaving a serene, ambient, close-up view of the glowing data flow.

```javascript
// Example in useExperienceState.js
const [phase, setPhase] = useState('INITIALIZING');
// Logic within useEffects will transition between phases based on timers or completion of animations.
```

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

#### **The Ocean Shader (`OceanShader.js`)**

This is the most technically complex part of the project.

*   **Uniforms**: The shader will receive data from our React component.
    *   `uTime`: A float representing elapsed time, used for all animation.
    *   `uBigWavesElevation`: Controls the height of the main waves.
    *   `uColorDeep`: The color for the wave troughs (e.g., deep indigo).
    *   `uColorSurface`: The color for the wave crests (e.g., bright magenta).
    *   `uCodeTexture`: The sampler2D for our texture of code glyphs.

*   **Vertex Shader Logic**:
    1.  Create multiple layers of Perlin noise using the vertex `x` and `z` coordinates plus `uTime`.
    2.  Combine these noise layers to create a more natural, complex wave pattern.
    3.  Displace the vertex `y` position using the final noise value.
    4.  Pass the final elevation to the fragment shader via a `varying`.

*   **Fragment Shader Logic**:
    1.  Use `mix()` to blend between `uColorDeep` and `uColorSurface` based on the `varying` elevation passed from the vertex shader.
    2.  Sample the `uCodeTexture`. The UV coordinates will be manipulated by `uTime` to create a constant scrolling/flowing effect.
    3.  The sampled texture color will be blended (`add` or `screen` blend mode) with the base wave color to make the code appear to glow *on* the waves.

#### **The Dissolution Effect**

This will be orchestrated in the `SceneController.jsx` by animating the props passed to `PostFx.jsx` and the camera position.

1.  **State Change**: The app state switches to `DISSOLVING`.
2.  **Camera Animation**: The camera's `z` position is animated forward, moving it "into" the waves.
3.  **Glitch Activation**: The `active` prop of the `<Glitch>` effect is set to `true`. Its `strength` and `ratio` properties can be animated to intensify the effect over a few seconds.
4.  **Audio Cue**: The `AudioPlayer` plays a burst of digital static.
5.  **Final State**: After the animation, the glitch effect is disabled, the camera is placed in its final, serene position, and the state changes to `ABSORBED`.

### 6. Potential Challenges & Mitigations

*   **Performance**: WebGL, especially with post-processing and complex shaders, can be demanding.
    *   **Mitigation**: Keep the ocean plane's subdivision count as low as possible while maintaining visual quality. Optimize the GLSL shader code. Use performance monitoring tools (`stats.js` from Drei) during development.
*   **Aesthetic Cohesion**: Achieving the "psychedelic" and "serene" feel is subjective.
    *   **Mitigation**: Frequent visual reviews. Expose key shader and animation parameters (colors, wave speed, bloom intensity) as controls in a debug UI (like `Leva`) for rapid iteration.
*   **Shader Development**: Writing GLSL can have a steep learning curve.
    *   **Mitigation**: Start with existing open-source ocean shaders and modify them. Use resources like The Book of Shaders and the Three.js journey course. Develop the shader in isolation before integrating it into the full experience.
